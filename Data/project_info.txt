This project aims to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. The primary goal is to answer user questions based on a provided set of documents. Key components of this system include document loading, text chunking for manageable processing, generating embeddings for semantic representation, efficient vector storage and retrieval, and finally, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to synthesize answers from retrieved contexts. The evaluation will initially be qualitative.
