Elephants are the largest land animals. Their tusks are actually elongated incisor teeth. Elephants communicate using a variety of sounds, including trumpets, rumbles, and roars, many of which are infrasonic and cannot be heard by humans. They live in complex social structures led by a matriarch.

Blue whales are the largest marine animals and indeed the largest animals ever known to have existed on Earth. Their hearts can weigh as much as a car. They primarily feed on tiny crustaceans called krill.

Cheetahs are the fastest land animals, capable of reaching speeds up to 75 mph (120 km/h) in short bursts. Unlike other big cats, cheetahs cannot roar but they can purr. Their spots provide camouflage in grasslands.
